## Rusty Metals Cycles

On the way to the Trader Joe's on University, Dale would hit an important fork, the turn before the river. On most occasions, he would make a right and head towards Al Maida's Hot Foods for his usual, two 750 mL Cacti seltzers, the novelty of buying Travis Scott paraphernalia drew him towards the brand over its competitors despite the flavor being ratchet and initially repulsive. Especially after its production discontinuation due to the "Astroworld festival tragedies", Dale found the drank to have the best cost-to-value ratio.

Today, he turned left, as he did many years ago when he first found his '87 560 Pro Series Trek frame at Rusty Metals Cycles. Fate brought him to the bike shop last time when an old friend showed him an eBay listing stating that there was a "MERCIER Reynolds 531 vintage road frame set 53cm / 54cm horizontal tube NOS" listed at $1,790. He decided to do some forensics on the value of this frame by visiting nearby bike shops. On his first stop, he was able to find this beautiful seafoam aqua Trek frame, in its original paint with zero chips and a sticker decal stating "Guaranteed built with Reynolds 531 BUTTED". Resembling a junkyard giveaway, Dale knew that this was true booty copped at $100.

The bike hung on a hook at his mom's garage. It's been there since he had Canon with Jaime. Canon was a solid name given his penchant for the hobbies. The triple entendre was only something his closest mates would find amusing as it was mostly an inside joke for himself. How Jaime allowed it bewildered him similarly. We can thank Wardell Curry Jr. for that one. Canon was a character, the precursor, before he could get his life back into normalcy. His friends always judged him for such a myopic and selfish view towards parenthood. But he also was a person who needed extrinsic motivation if he were to overcome his true demons – like his regular walks to Al Maida's hot foods.

The faint memories of the walk gave his muscles the strength and cognition to clumsily arrive at Rusty Metals Cycles unscathed. Chucks the last Cacti over a fence, littering is cool. Without acknowledging the existence of the staff, he immediately goes into foraging mode. The scene would be appropriately narrated by David Attenborough based on his iguana-like arms digging through piles of ostensibly usable bike parts. The subsection in the back of the edifice was full of scrap parts in bins, a microcosm in and of itself. They were unsorted and ranging in quality but he knew that good parts were available. His old friend Robbie would frequently boast of finding parts like a Shimano CS-M6100. The part numbers weren't too familiar to Dale but he knew Robbie by his collection and he wouldn't get anything below "Deore".

_Hey, is there anything you're looking for today?_

_Oh, isn't your name Jesus? I went to school with your brother Abner at Berkeley High. Didn't you try to buy weed from me once?_

_Oh yeah, that's me, I just go by Jess now._

This was a common type of encounter. Having spent his entirety in Berkeley, it seemed like he knew everything and everyone transitively and only within one degree. He remembered Jesus, vaguely from the days when he would visit his apartment and play Halo 3 with Abner and the Mexican friends. He started to conjure the narrative about how Jesus became a Jess at a bike shop.

_Hey, so a few years ago, I found a trek frame I'm trying to build, it's an older road frameset. Whatchu think I should look for first?_

_Oh word, we get a lot of donations from that era. I think there might be some stems and handlebars we got in that's good for that._

Jess knew what he was talking about. In no time, Dale dug up a used but salvageable quill stem by SomaFab, a boutique brand he recognized. Just a bit of sandpaper into steel wool would eliminate any superficial rust. What's more, the Sutro stem length was around 180mm, which was ideal for the upright _formerly_ inebriated riding he was interested in. Dale would proceed to checkout, $25 at the counter; scandalous if you didn't know what you were doing. The prices were the same for all parts of the same kind. A performative eBay check showing Jess how much of a come-up this was gave Dale satisfaction. Part two of many to come he hopes, another step towards the right direction. He pulled out this offensively matte royal purple Bank of America government prepaid card with cross-hatched white stripes curving in an infinity symbol orientation to pay for the damages.

After a year of _figuring out what he was going to do_, Jess found himself still at the bike co-op, in constant melancholy questioning his life choices. His bike shop friends were starting to be more than just simulacrums of projected dreams and a simple lifestyle. He knew these people's last names at this point, an ominous and troublesome sign. Unlike his brother, Jess had issues with racing thoughts in his mind about the dred of humanity. The only way he could find resolve was to surround himself with a set of solvable problems. He thought of bikes as rubik's cubes with an order of magnitude increase in complexity. The novelty of seeing humans who found similar appeal in the hobby was sometimes more of a distraction and aberration given his introspective tendencies.

Even within this niche of working on bikes, it became obvious to Jess that the store's personnel skewed towards cycling as an extreme sport, fitting given the name Rusty Metal Cycles. He was more of a touring cyclist, often going on a thousand mile rides for similar reasons to the rubik's cube. The constant agony of pedaling for long durations would distract him from thoughts. When his thoughts couldn't be suppressed by the pressing physical matters at hand, he had time to experiment on the ludicrousy of these endless idea streams. His thoughts came wrapped as value judgments by former people in his life, some with the loosest of affiliations. The most recent absurd one was from Candice, just a high school acquaintance who saw him fall asleep with a literal boner in trigonometry due to the cringeworthy story of the Algonquin tribe not knowing how to enclose a fence efficiently with limited materials from until chief SOH-CAH-TOA somehow calculated the distance using math. Apparently, they were going to die from bear attacks if it weren't for trigonometry.

_Nice shorts._ She said.

These bike rides would last for days, oftentimes averaging 10 hours. He concluded that it was unhealthy to think of Candice, because Candice is something lesser than a Facebook friend to you who spends zero thinking about you. So, rationally, why does it make sense for you to think about her when she spends no time thinking about you? By definition, that seems like letting someone live in your head rent-free.

He was actively trying to determine who these bike shop people were, just another Candice or something more? These wistful memories of people who projected thoughts onto him seemed romantic at times and it was this feeling that led him to still "figure things out".

_Hey Jess, I'm looking for some mounting brackets that can go on my bike tube. It's pretty specific but let me show you an image of what I'm looking for._

_Oh, I don't know if we have any of those, what are you trying to do?_

These were the conversations that would make folks like Dale more than just a Candice. Dale had been coming to the bike shop regularly for about two months now, regularly picking up parts. Jess remembers each transaction since he helped Dale obtain most of the components. In theory, the bike should almost be complete by now. He was curious thusly about the need for the tube mounts.

_Your mama didn't tell you about it? I had a kid a couple years ago with Jaime. I'm trying to mount a toddler seat on the top tube of the bike and take him riding._

Jess detached himself from a lot of the tangential family friends and only knew Dale in the context of this bike part procurement protocol. What Dale aspired to do made a lot of sense now that he knew about Canon, his kid. Over time, he had noticed that Dale was looking more upright and conscientious of his surroundings. Definitely smelling less like Cacti, which Jess can distinctly recognize since his mamma and friends were all about the buzz for the low. That and also the weird accumulation of smashed cans in the gated alley to the back entrance made more sense now.

This gave him an extra oomph to problem-solve; not merely brute force some solution with marginal parts from this co-op. Despite being pretty unfamiliar with bike accessories for children, a brisk internet search led him to Shotgun, a New Zealand company solely dedicated to making toddler seats with direct mounts to the stem and seat-post, a secondary front tube. At around two hundred bucks, this would truly test Dale's courage and willingness to walk away from Al Maida's Hot Foods. Comically, he even had a bet with the owner on the date of his return. He had already won the bet at this point, but the goal wasn't simply to win friendly wagers with bodega cashiers. The goal was to have a bike for Canon, Dale riding.

_Alright Jess, appreciate you, I'll probably cop from there._

Jess thinks about Dale, a different type of wonder, not because his image broadcasted a value judgment but he had genuine affection and concern about Dale's wellness. He thinks about the fully assembled Trek bike with all of the accoutrements and the ride Dale potentially went on with his son.

The next day, Dale was on the way to the Trader Joe's on University thinking about the right turn.
